CURRENT API VERSION: 2.0
------------------------
This file contains a list of API revisions and the breaking changes that may
affect developers of modules integrating with Address Field Lookup.

API VERSION 2.0
---------------
* Refactored setLookupTerm(), lookup() and getLookupResult() functions into a
  single function - lookup($term). This function now accepts the search term
  as a required paramater and returns either the array of search results or
  FALSE if no results could be found.

* All integrating modules must define a 'object factory' key in their
  implementation of hook_addressfield_lookup_service_info. This key refers to
  a function responsible for instantiating the PHP class that implements the
  AddressFieldLookupInterface interface. The function receives the service info
  array as a parameter.

* hook_addressfield_lookup_get_service_object no longer exists. Any module
  functions implementing this hook will not be invoked. See the 'object factory'
  details in the above bullet point and the example module which can be found
  in tests/modules/addressfield_lookup_example.

* The functions addressfield_lookup_get_addresses() and
  addressfield_lookup_get_address_details() no longer accept a $show_errors
  parameter. The 2nd parameter on both functions is now the cache reset
  parameter. See addressfield_lookup.module for more details.
